## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com) - Open-Source JS library for Maps
- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org) - API for IP geolocation

### What I learned

This is the first project that I use an external JS library, in this case I used it for a map. I have to say that it was really cool and easy to use it. I think that reading library and API docs is a very good skill beacuse you learn how to use a tool in a really short amount of time.

### Continued development

I wanna keep practicing my JS skills, I think that I am getting good with JS but I still want to practice.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries Breakpoints 2025](https://dev.to/gerryleonugroho/responsive-design-breakpoints-2025-playbook-53ih) - I always refer to this website but it is an incredible website with very useful information.
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com) - On the website there are docs with information about how to use it.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org) - Same as LeafletJS
